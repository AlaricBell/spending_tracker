## Introduction

This project is a simple tool to manually track your spending records, it was written in [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org) using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) and [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) as local / serverside state management.
[framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) was used for animations and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) for styling

As of now (**2023/10/23**) only `POST` and `GET` requests are supported.
